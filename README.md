# Snake
by

---
The classic game implemented on Haskell. There is a _snake_ which slithers on the game field.
* The goal is to grow the snake as much as possible by eating the food
* Pieces of the food randomly spawned on the field 
* Use _Up_, _Down_, _Right_, _Left_ buttons to control the snake. Click the one rapidly to make the snake faster
* Game will be over when the snake bumps into its own tail or any wall
* Click _"p"_ to pause the game and _"s"_ to un-pause or to restart the game in case you have failed
* Click _esc_ to exit the game. 

#### Build
* Use `stack build` to build the project.
* Use `stack run` to run it. Enjoy! :)
